pages_helper.py, the star's bridge to DaVinci Resolve's pages. Part of the
DaVinci Resolve Assistant (~/Developer/resolve-scripts). Marko, 9.9.2026:
"I need something which is same as Alt+Tab or Command+Tab in the Mac ... It
needs to jump only between spaces which user enabled."

One long-lived process, started by apps/pages.lua while Resolve runs, so a
press of the shortcut never waits for Python and the Resolve API to wake up.
Lines in on stdin, lines out on stdout:

    in   read                  out  page color
    in   open fusion           out  page fusion        (or  error ...)
    in   pages                 out  pages edit,fusion,color,fairlight,deliver
    in   quit                  the process ends

and by itself, every time Resolve's page changes (looked at twice a second:
Resolve's API has no event for it, so this is the one place a poll exists),
a line  page <name>.  While Resolve is up but not answering (a project still
loading, External scripting not set to Local) the helper says  waiting  once
and keeps trying every few seconds; when Resolve is gone it says  gone  and
exits. Every failure is written to ~/.config/resolve-assistant.log with the
time, never to the screen.

WHICH PAGES ARE ENABLED comes from Resolve's own page bar. The API cannot say,
but Resolve writes its choice to ~/Library/Preferences/Blackmagic Design/
DaVinci Resolve/UI.preset, a hex-encoded Qt stream holding one block of
settings per screen resolution; the live block is the one named by
LastUsedResolution. In that block the keys ShowMediaPage, ShowCutPage,
ShowEditPage, ShowFusionPage, ShowColorPage, ShowFairlightPage,
ShowDeliverPage and ShowPhotoPage each carry a one-byte bool.
